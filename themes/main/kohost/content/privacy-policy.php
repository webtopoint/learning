                            to link); (b)the organization does not have an unsatisfactory record with us; (c) the benefit to us from
                            the visibility associated with the hyperlink outweighs the absence of Kohost; and (d) where the
                            link is in the context of general resource information or is otherwise consistent with editorial content

                            of the linking party and it products or services; and (c) fits within the context of the linking party's
